# CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR ( CO )

## DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLUTION

THE PROJECT CONSISTS IN DETECTING THE LEVEL OF MONOXIDE CARBON ( CO ) IN THE AIR, THE MQ-7 SENSOR WILL DETECT THE PRECISE LEVELS AND THE RGB LED WILL CHANGE ITS COLOR ACCORDING TO THE LOW/HIGH LEVEL OF CO DETECTED.

-GREEN LIGHT: LOW LEVEL ==> NO RISKS

-RED LIGHT: HIGH LEVEL ==> RISKS

-FLASHING LIGHT: VALUES ARE IN A CERTAIN RANGE ==> RISKS

## GLOBAL SCHEMA OF OUR SOLUTION

BOTH THE SENSOR AND THE RGB ARE PLACED ON THE BREADBOARD, WE ARE WORKING WITH AN ARUDUINO UNO. THE ENTIRE CODE IS WRITTEN IN C++. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PRECISE RESULTS THE SENSOR HAS BEEN SOLDER WELDED TO ITS PCB AND THEN CONNECTED TO THE BREADBORD THANKS TO MALE HEADERS, ALSO THESE ONE HAVE BEEN WELDED TO THE PCB, IN THE VIDEO WILL BE SHOWN THE FINAL RESULT.

THE MQ7 SENSOR REQUIRES FEW MINUTES OF PRE-HEATING, GENERALLY AFTER 10/15 MINUTES RESULTS ARE REALLY ACCURATE. THANKS TO THE ARDUINO PLOTTER MONITOR WE ARE ABLE TO VISUALIZE GRAPHICALLY WHAT THE SENSOR IS DETECTING AND HOW MUCH. WITH THE ARDUINO SERIAL MONITOR INSTEAD WE CAN SEE THE PRECISE VALUE DETECTED BY THE SENSOR.
